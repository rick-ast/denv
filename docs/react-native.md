## Environment Setup

1. Install `Xcode` via the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

- `brew install git`
- `brew install node@<LTS>`
- `brew link node@<LTS>`
- `brew install cocoapods` # system ruby may mismatch the version cocoapods required, use brew instead of gem
